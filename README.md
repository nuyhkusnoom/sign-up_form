# sign-up_form

My second project from The Odin Project. This is to get practice using HTML forms and CSS and just design in general. Just kind of thrown into the deep end with this one after learning a few concepts. I guess I'll figure it out.

I want to make a sign-up page for a fictional web-based game service. Maybe I can re-use the code in the future.

TO-DO:

<li>
    <ul>[X] Get Background Images</ul>
    <ul>[X] Overall Scaffolding Design</ul>
    <ul>[X] Forms</ul>
    <ul>[X] Password Check (Javascript)</ul>
    <ul>[X] Submit Button</ul>
    <ul>[X] Login Page Link</ul>
</li>

UPDATE: August 1, 2022

Did everything in one day, much faster than I expected. It was good practice working with design. Overall, I like how the page turned out very clean, and I think I'm enjoying the designing process.
